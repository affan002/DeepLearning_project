Since connecting two external monitors, I don't have much desktop space, so I don't like having a host taking up room.

Personally, I wouldn't recommend Win10/11 S mode; to be blunt, it's a monopolistic version. In S mode, you can't install .exe, .msi... nor can you use Chrome, Brave.... You can only install things from the Microsoft Store and use the Edge browser; you have no choice but to use Microsoft products. Generally, home computers come with the Home edition (you cannot stop forced updates). Commercial computers come with the Pro edition. Additionally, I personally feel antivirus software is unnecessary. Last year, I bought an M2 SSD online, which came with PCCillin 2021, but after installing it, I found it was constantly scanning for viruses, similar to the annoying Windows Defender. Just avoid clicking on programs from unknown sources. If you're still worried, you can right-click and use the built-in Defender to scan. Furthermore, for a document-focused laptop, choose an i3/r3 (above 16,000 NTD would be better) or higher. Lower-end Celeron/Pentium/Athlon are also suitable for documents, but only \"barely usable\" (priced around 10,000 NTD). In short, if you see a CPU with NXXXX on a shopping website, don't buy it, and eMMC is not recommended. If your budget is sufficient, buy i5/r5 or higher for better performance. The latest is 13th gen, but it's still a bit expensive. 11th or 12th gen is fine, but avoid 10th gen. Memory is usually pre-installed 8GB. If you want to expand, you need to check how much RAM that laptop supports maximum. I remember home computers generally support up to 16GB, while commercial/gaming computers support more. 8GB is a bit tight because Win11 uses 3-4GB RAM upon startup. It's recommended to expand to 16GB. For storage, an M.2 SSD is a must; HDD is optional. The screen is usually FHD. Commercial computers generally use better materials and usually have security features like fingerprint recognition and facial recognition; this is where they differ from home computers. Also, most home computers on the market \"do not\" include a bag or mouse, while commercial computers generally do; pay attention to this. Hope this helps!", "Quadruplet": [{"Aspect": "Antivirus software", "Category": "SOFTWARE#GENERAL", "Opinion": "Unnecessary", "VA": "4.00#5.25"}]}
